Binary Classfication Pipeline which uses Haberman's Survival Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Haberman's+Survival)

To reproduce the ML pipeline, run `dvc repro`. As you make changes, run dvc repro to reproduce the pipeline to version the new output with the changed code. 
To take a screenshot with the new added asset, make a new commit. As you push to GitHub, a new workflow will start running.
